# stream-in-scala
This is a sample project that accompanies the blog post [Stream in Scala](https://blog.lunatech.com/stream-in-scala/).

<br/>
The project is divided into two parts:

<br>
1. LogStream: A simple application that reads log files and prints the lines to the console using scala LazyList.

<br>
2. AkkaStream: A simple application that reads log files and prints the lines to the console using akka streams.
